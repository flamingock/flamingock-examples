**Flamingock** is the evolution of Mongock, designed as a cloud-native solution for managing versioning, and auditing
changes in systems that evolve alongside your application.

Whilst Mongock focused on versioning NoSQL databases, Flamingock extends this concept to all technologies, systems, and
configurations, with built-in auditing and rollback capabilities. It ensures the application and its dependent
components evolve together, managing configuration changes during the application startup to enable seamless integration
and deployment.

Flamingock also introduces new mechanisms for defining changes in an extensible and customizable manner, beyond
traditional  code-based methods.

> Additionally, Flamingock offers multiple infrastructure setups for providing flexibility to users, as it introduces a
Cloud offering whilst still retaining existing supported databases such as MongoDB, DynamoDB, or Couchbase.

---

## Examples Overview

This repository is structured as **Individual Gradle Projects**, with each project demonstrating Flamingock's
integration with different frameworks, technologies, and use cases. Explore the examples to find the one that matches
your needs!

Each example is prepared to run from its own test with all infrastructure (databases, mocked servers, etc.) needed.
But you can also  run it with your own infrastructure.


## Migration from Mongock to Flamingock

If you're transitioning from Mongock to Flamingock, we have a [dedicated project](import-from-mongock/README_2.md) to guide you.
