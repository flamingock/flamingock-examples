**Flamingock** is the evolution of Mongock, designed as a cloud-native solution for managing versioning, and auditing changes in systems that evolve alongside your application.

Whilst Mongock focused on versioning NoSQL databases, Flamingock extends this concept to all technologies, systems, and configurations, with built-in auditing and rollback capabilities. It ensures the application and its dependent components evolve together, managing configuration changes during the application startup to enable seamless integration and deployment.

Flamingock also introduces new mechanisms for defining changes in an extensible and customizable manner, beyond traditional code-based methods.

> Additionally, Flamingock offers multiple infrastructure setups for providing flexibility to users, as it introduces a Cloud offering whilst still retaining existing supported databases such as MongoDB, DynamoDB, or Couchbase.
