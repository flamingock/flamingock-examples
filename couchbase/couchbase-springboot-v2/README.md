# Couchbase Springboot with Springdata Example

## üìñ Example Overview

Welcome to the Couchbase Springboot with Springdata Example. This demonstrates how to use Flamingock with Couchbase in a
Java Springboot application with Springdata. It highlights key functionalities such as configuring Flamingock to use
Springdata for Couchbase as storage driver and defining a Rollback execution to your changes.

As Springboot application, Flamingock configuration was in *resources/application.yml*:
```yaml
flamingock:
   couchbase:
      scope: examplescope
      collection: examplecollection
   stages:
      - name: stage1
        code-packages:
           - io.flamingock.examples.community.couchbase.changes
   transactionEnabled: false
```

This example has 1 Flamingock Change:
1. Initialize an index in a bucket called *bucket*. With Rollback that drops that bucket.
```java
    @RollbackExecution
    public void rollbackExecution(Cluster cluster) {
        cluster.queryIndexes().dropIndex("bucket", "idx_springboot_index", DropQueryIndexOptions.dropQueryIndexOptions().ignoreIfNotExists(true));
    }
```
