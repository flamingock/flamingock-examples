# Couchbase Standalone Example

## 📖 Example Overview

Welcome to the Couchbase Standalone Example. This demonstrates how to use Flamingock with Couchbase in a Java
standalone application. It highlights key functionalities such as auditing changes, configuring advanced and optional
Flamingock Builder options, and implementing Pipeline Listeners.

This example has 1 Flamingock Changes:
1. Initialize an index in a bucket called *bucket*. With Rollback that drops that bucket.
```java
    @RollbackExecution
    public void rollbackExecution(Cluster cluster) {
       cluster.queryIndexes().dropIndex("bucket", "idx_standalone_index", DropQueryIndexOptions.dropQueryIndexOptions().ignoreIfNotExists(true));
    }
```
