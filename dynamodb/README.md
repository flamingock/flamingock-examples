## üìå Dependencies

This example requires the following dependencies:
### Flamingock dependencies
    implementation(platform("io.flamingock:flamingock-ce-bom:$flamingockVersion"))
    implementation("io.flamingock:flamingock-ce-dynamodb")
    annotationProcessor("io.flamingock:flamingock-processor")

### DynamoDB dependencies
    implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb-enhanced:2.25.28")
    implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:url-connection-client:2.24.11")

## üõ† How to run this example

There are two ways to run this example:

### 1. Running tests (Recomended)
The recommended method to run this example is by executing the tests, which include a DynamoDB Local Service for testing
purposes.
```shell
./gradlew test
```

### 2. Running the main class
For this option, you'll need to configure your own DynamoDB connection:
1. Open the main class file
2. Configure the DynamoDB client builder with your settings in DynamoDBUtil class:
```java
    public static DynamoDbClient getClient() throws URISyntaxException {
   return DynamoDbClient.builder()
           .region(Region.EU_WEST_1) // Set your AWS region
           .endpointOverride(new URI("http://localhost:8000")) // Set your DynamoDB endpoint
           .credentialsProvider(
                   StaticCredentialsProvider.create(
                           AwsBasicCredentials.create("dummye", "dummye") // Set your AWS credentials
                   )
           )
           .build();
}
```
3. Run the example:
```shell
./gradlew run
```
