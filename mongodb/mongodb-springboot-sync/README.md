# MongoDB Springboot Example

## üìñ Example Overview

Welcome to the MongoDB Springboot Example. This demonstrates how to use Flamingock with MongoDB in a Java
Springboot application. It highlights key functionalities such as configuring Flamingock in a Springboot application.

As Springboot application, Flamingock configuration was in *resources/application.yml*:
```yaml
flamingock:
  stages:
    - name: stage1
      code-packages:
        - io.flamingock.examples.mongodb.springboot.sync.changes
  transactionEnabled: true
```

This example has 3 Flamingock Changes:
1. Creates a new collection called *clientCollection*.
2. Adds one document to collection.
3. Adds another document to collection.

## üìå Dependencies

This example requires the following dependencies:
### Flamingock Dependencies
    implementation("io.flamingock:flamingock-springboot-v2-runner:0.0.30-beta")
    implementation("io.flamingock:mongodb-sync-v4-driver:0.0.30-beta")

### Springboot Dependency
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")

### MongoDB Dependencies
    implementation("org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.3.3")
    implementation("org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-core:4.3.3")
    implementation("org.mongodb:bson:4.3.3")

Also, it requieres the following plugins:
### Springboot plugins
    id("org.springframework.boot") version "2.7.12"
    id("io.spring.dependency-management") version "1.1.0"

## üõ† How to Run this Example

There are two ways to run this example:

### 1. Run Test (Recomended)
The recommended method to run this example is by executing the tests, which include a MongoDB TestContainer for testing
purposes.
```shell
./gradlew test
```

### 2. Run Main Class
To run the main class, ensure you have MongoDB running. Configure a Springboot bean with your own endpoint that returns
a MongoClient object, if needed. And run example with:
```shell
./gradlew run
```

## ‚úÖ Proven functionalities

This example demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. Configuring Flamingock in a Springboot application
   - Configure Driver as Springboot Bean
   - Configure Changes parameters as Springboot Beans
   - Set Stages and other configuration in *resources/application.yml*
   - Set Listeners as Springboot Beans too
