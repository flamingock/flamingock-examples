# MongoDB Springboot v3 with Springdata v4 Example

## üìñ Example Overview

Welcome to the MongoDB Springboot v3 with Springdata v4 Example. This demonstrates how to use Flamingock with MongoDB in
a Java Springboot v3 application with Springdata v4. It highlights key functionalities such as configuring Flamingock in
a Springboot v3 application using Springdata v4 as storage driver.

As Springboot application, Flamingock configuration was in *resources/application.yml*:
```yaml
flamingock:
   stages:
      - name: stage1
        code-packages:
           - io.flamingock.examples.community.changes
   transactionEnabled: true
```
