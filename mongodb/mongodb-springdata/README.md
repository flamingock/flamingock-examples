## Dependencies

This example requires the following dependencies:
### Flamingock dependencies
    implementation(platform("io.flamingock:flamingock-ce-bom:$flamingockVersion"))
    implementation("io.flamingock:flamingock-community")
    implementation("io.flamingock:flamingock-springboot-integration")
    annotationProcessor("io.flamingock:flamingock-processor")

### Springboot dependency
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")

### Springdata for MongoDB dependency
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb")

Also, it requieres the following plugins:

    id("org.springframework.boot") version "3.5.3"
    id("io.spring.dependency-management") version "1.1.7"

### Compatibility versions

Check out the [compatibility documentation](compatibility_versions.md) for using Flamingock with Spring Boot and MongoDB Spring Data.

## How to run this example

There are two ways to run this example:

### 1. Running tests (Recomended)
The recommended method to run this example is by executing the tests, which include a MongoDB TestContainer for testing
purposes.
```shell
./gradlew test
```

### 2. Running the main class
To run the main class, ensure you have MongoDB running. Configure Springdata to use your own endpoint. Additionally:
1. Open the main class file
2. Change MongoDB endpoint in the following line for Mongock simulated execution:
```java
//        This line adds data to simulate previous legacy Mongock executions
        MongockExecutor.addMongockLegacyData("mongodb://localhost:27017/", DATABASE_NAME);
```
3. Run the example:
```shell
./gradlew run
```

## Proven functionalities

This example demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. Configuring Flamingock in a Springboot application
   - Demonstrates how to use Flamingock with Springboot.
2. Auditing Changes with Springdata
   - Demonstrates how to audit changes using Springdata as the storage backend.
